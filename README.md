# Project3

This project uses logistic regression and random forest to classify whether revenue resulted from online shopper intention features.
The metrics that are used to determine model validity are precision, recall, accuracy, and f1 score.  Precision is the percentage of true positive classifications 
among all positive classifications.  Recall is the percentage of true positive classifications among all true classifications.  Accuracy is the pecentage of 
true classifications among all classifications.  f1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
